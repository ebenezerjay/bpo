        "I was fortunate to be part of a Backcountry Journeys photo trip to Lake Clark National Park in 2018. I witnessed the same 
        breathtaking beauty the photographers enjoyed. I felt compelled to create an Art piece bringing the highlights of my 
        experience together. If you visit this place, you will gain a greater understanding of this piece. I hope you like it."

        "This canvas painting is based on a camping and kayaking trip to Grewingk glacier. It's near Homer Alaska, across Kachemak 
        bay.  After jumping off the water taxi and unloading our kayaks and gear, we spotted a mother black bear with her cubs 
        across a small field from our camp. The next morning in a mixture of thick fog and bright sunlight we started our three 
        mile hike to the glacier. I was stunned by the rich thick forest full of mushrooms, flowers, and mosses. Roughly halfway 
        into our hike we encountered a mother black bear with her playful cubs on the trail. We waited patiently as they slowly 
        made their way into the thick forest.  After arriving at the lake in some warm sunshine, my friend and I put on our dry-suits
        and went for a swim. It was a pleasure and unique experience to enjoy ice water and floating icebergs. We sat peacefully on 
        the shore for hours taking in the extraordinary beauty. I knew then, I was going to create an Art piece of my experience.  
        My painting features the vigilant mother black bear taking her playful cubs to the lake for a swim. The painting is nearing 
        completion and will be released shortly. This will also be offered in a very limited number of prints. Thanks for your 
        interest."
