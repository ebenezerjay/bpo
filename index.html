        "Bears Everywhere" has just been released (on Thanksgiving Day) as an edition of 10. Each of the 10 prints are 20" by 24" 
        on artist quality canvas. If you've spent time around Alaska's great bears this is a special artwork to own & treasure. Brian's works are only 
        printed in Limited Edition runs - a great holiday gift and shipping is free to the lower 48.
        There are only 10 available and we do expect these to go fast - after all there is no better gift than Art!

        "I was fortunate to be part of a Backcountry Journeys photo trip to Lake Clark National Park in 2018. I witnessed the same 
        breathtaking beauty the photographers enjoyed. I felt compelled to create an Art piece bringing the highlights of my 
        experience together. If you visit this place, you will gain a greater understanding of this piece. I hope you like it."
